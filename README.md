## Speech-to-text-data_collection

## Introduction
In this project,we are going to design and build a robust, large scale, fault tolerant, highly available Kafka cluster that can be used to
post a sentence and receive an audio file.

By the end of this project we will produce a tool that can be deployed to process posting and receiving text and audio files from and into a data lake, apply
transformation in a distributed manner, and load it into a warehouse in a suitable format to train a speech-to-text model.
